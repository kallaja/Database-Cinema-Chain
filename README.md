# 🎬 Cinema Chain Database Project

This project contains the SQL script for building a relational database designed for managing a cinema chain. The structure was created as part of a university course project and reflects real-world business logic 
for handling movies, cinemas, tickets, and customer interactions.

## 🗂️ Overview

The database was developed using **MariaDB** and exported via **Navicat Premium**. It includes tables related to movies, cinema locations, screenings, ticketing, orders, discounts, and user roles.

## 🔧 Technologies

- Database System: **MariaDB**
- Export Tool: **Navicat Premium**

## 📑 Database Diagram

## 💡 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Relational database design** with foreign keys and indexing
- **Normalization** of data (separate tables for discounts, roles, etc.)
- Handling **many-to-one** and **many-to-many** relationships
- **Real-world scenario modeling** for cinema operations

## 📥 How to Use

1. Open your MariaDB/MySQL-compatible environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, Navicat).
2. Create a new schema/database (e.g., `cinema_chain`).
3. Run the SQL script provided in this repository to build the schema and tables.
4. You can then populate it with data manually or via additional scripts.

## 🌍 Language Notes

The table and column names in the SQL script are in **Polish**, but this README provides English translations to make the project understandable.
